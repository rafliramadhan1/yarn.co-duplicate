1
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:37,889
Okay.

2
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,858
You all right?

3
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,402
Yeah.

4
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:00,870
You'd think these trips would get easier,
but it's just the opposite.

5
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:04,332
Well, I feel the same way, Ange.

6
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,754
I know this is what we do.
This is our life.

7
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:13,591
But it just seems like the world
is moving so fast...

8
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:18,513
...and right now
things are changing so much.

9
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,600
They sure are.

10
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,980
I'll tell you something.
It's not gonna be easy for our kids.

11
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,859
They're going into a different world
than the one you and I came into.

12
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,528
Yeah.

13
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,906
You know,
both our kids are doing great.

14
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:40,910
But it worries me when Danny
doesn't take school seriously.

15
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,455
Him missing class.
That could come out...

16
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:48,000
It might hurt him when he's out
looking for a job, you know?

17
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,045
The competition out there.
When I was starting out...

18
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:54,882
...you could make captain if you put
your head down and did your work.

19
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,759
But young guys coming up now...

20
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:59,095
Companies want things faster
and cheaper.

21
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:02,014
And 50 guys compete for every job.

22
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,560
Everything's different,
and big wheels are turning.

23
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,937
You gotta be strong
to survive out there.

24
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:13,401
I hear what you're saying.

25
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:15,862
It's gonna be okay, right?

26
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,071
Oh, yeah.

27
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,659
Gonna be okay.

28
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,922
This is a special
security announcement.

29
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,467
Please maintain control
of your personal belongings at all times.

30
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:44,181
Unattended baggage is subject
to search, inspection and removal.

31
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,645
- I love you.
- Love you too.

32
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:54,025
- Have a safe trip.
- I'll call you from there.

33
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,027
They're here!

34
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,821
Hurry, Muse!

35
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,927
What the hell are you doing?
Why aren't you out on the water?

36
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:05,930
You know what you're supposed to do!

37
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:11,102
You should be out there
earning money!

38
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,813
But we caught a ship last week.

39
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,940
That was last week!

40
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,526
The boss wants money today!

41
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:21,237
Bring Garaad another ship soon...

42
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,114
...or you will answer for it!

43
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,617
Everybody, get back to work now!

44
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,879
Stay out of my way today.

45
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,759
Hufan!

46
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:47,013
I'm going to get us something big!

47
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:51,058
Those who want to make money,
come.

48
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,437
Muse, take me with you.

49
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,480
Does your sister know you're here?

50
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,941
She's selling khat up there.

51
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,986
This is her best stuff.

52
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,997
When we get a big ship,
you will be well paid.

53
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:14,874
You want to work?

54
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,168
Do you know how to steer a boat?

55
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,545
Go, go.

56
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:21,213
I'm ready.

57
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,049
- What do you have for me?
- Money.

58
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,469
- When are you gonna give it to me?
- As soon as we're paid.

59
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:30,097
Spread out!

60
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:34,727
Let my other man choose his crew.

61
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,689
Next time bring me something
if you want to work.

62
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,703
Come on, Bilal.

63
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:58,334
Hey, Skinny, I can steer your boat.

64
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,628
If you choose me, you won't regret it.

65
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:04,924
Okay, Elmi.

66
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:11,013
I need somebody strong.

67
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,142
Somebody like this?

68
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,279
I want him.

69
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,116
Get out of my way!

70
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,037
Why did he pick him?

71
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,456
He's from another village.

72
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,924
Move!

73
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:32,052
Faster, move faster!

74
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,063
See if you can get more power.

75
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,233
Okay.

76
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,943
You!

77
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,614
Get over here!

78
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,574
Come help us!

79
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:59,598
Okay, pull it in!

80
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,100
Sign right there, sir.

81
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,810
You have a good day.

82
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,896
- Hello, Cap. Let me get that for you.
- Morning.

83
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,159
Attention, all crew. All crew.

84
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:03,120
1500 departure three out.

85
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,714
- Hey, good to see you, Cap.
- Shane. Good to see you.

86
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:16,383
- Good to see you.
- Hey. Carry on.

87
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,843
- Hey, bos?
- Yeah?

88
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:19,928
Get on that safety rail, huh?

89
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,305
- Kenny.
- Yeah?

90
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:25,809
I want you to go down to the deck office,
grab Jimmy, get on the Lodestar.

91
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,521
That ballast, move it five points.

92
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,732
- Take care of that now.
- You got it.

93
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,234
How's the family, Cap?

94
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,195
Oh, you know.

95
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:40,199
Andrea's a champ, one kid gone,
another kid going.

96
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,617
How are the boxes?

97
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,870
Oh, you know.
Just putting a few last containers on.

98
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,208
Twenty-four hundred tons of
commercial cargo, 200 tons of food aid...

99
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:54,505
...166 tons of freshwater,
250 metric tons of fuel bunkered.

100
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,007
Walk me through the plan.

101
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,303
So here we are in Salalah.

102
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:05,516
Travel down the coalition corridor
to Djibouti.

103
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:09,103
Then we exit the shipping lane
south of Socotra.

104
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,021
Socotra, okay.

105
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:15,609
Then we're on our own down the coast
through the Somali Basin...

106
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:17,903
...all the way down to Mombasa.

107
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,155
We need five minutes
on that reefer bow.

108
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:26,912
We should be able
to unload the containers around 0800.

109
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:31,166
Well, let's tighten up security.

110
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:34,169
We are going
around the Horn of Africa, right?

111
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:38,424
We got pirate cages. They were all open.
All the doors are unlocked.

112
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,260
I want everything closed, locked,
even in port.

113
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,973
- Right.
- Fine. Ready to leave. 1500.

114
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:48,183
Absolutely, Cap. You got it.

115
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,109
Stow the gangway.

116
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,485
Last lines in.

117
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,905
Okay. Lower it.

118
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:05,367
Sixteen-B ready. Take it up.

119
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:07,661
Tighten it up.

120
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,830
Hey, slow down.

121
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,918
Bow clear.

122
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,295
Stern lines are clear.

123
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,213
Bow thruster full starboard.

124
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,800
Bow thruster on.

125
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,309
All lines clear. Ship is under way.

126
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,188
- Dead slow ahead.
- Dead slow ahead.

127
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,995
Keep those hatches locked down.

128
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,455
- Cap.
- Morning.

129
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,137
Check that rigging.

130
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,236
- Shane.
- Yeah?

131
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,862
We need those time sheets.

132
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:09,074
She's winking at me.
But it turns out that's what they do.

133
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:11,577
I'll show you this place. I'll take you.

134
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,705
I'll have two beers
and a bucketful of sin, please.

135
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:18,625
Yeah. About done with that coffee?

136
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,212
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we're done.

137
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,464
That's 15, guys.

138
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,967
Back to work. Come on, let's go.

139
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:30,012
- Jesus.
- See you down there, Mike.

140
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,989
Their main route is packed
with ships...

141
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,160
...but we can't attack a herd.

142
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,711
This one is alone.

143
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,396
Morning.

144
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,147
Hey, Cap.

145
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,899
- Cap.
- Morning, Cap.

146
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:09,778
Shane, I want to do some security drills,
unannounced.

147
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,446
Starting now.

148
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:14,032
What? Fire, man overboard?

149
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,785
Everything.
Ken, you're the duty officer?

150
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,412
- Yeah, Cap.
- Right.

151
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,124
Boat with two armed men is approaching
on your starboard beam.

152
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,085
- No, no. Whistle first.
- Let's go.

153
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:29,756
That way the pirates know we're aware
of them and are ready to defend the ship.

154
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,592
Hustle up. Let's go.

155
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:35,178
Attention, all crew.

156
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:38,557
All crew.
All men to your stations on deck.

157
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:42,310
Repeat,
all men to your deck stations now.

158
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,354
Let's do this.

159
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:53,739
Come on... Get those keys off your hip.
Put them in your pocket. Come on, guys.

160
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,074
Pirates capture you
and find those keys...

161
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,827
...they'll have access to every door
on this ship.

162
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,545
Get those hoses on.

163
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:11,423
Bring it around, bring around,
bring around.

164
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,342
- Watch it, man.
- Ready with number six.

165
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,635
All right.

166
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:17,387
You tied up?

167
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,098
All done here, Shane.

168
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,352
- Hey, Cap, this is Shane. Do you read?
- Yeah, Shane, go ahead.

169
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,190
Things are looking good down here.
We're getting close with the hoses.

170
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:31,401
All right. Let me know
when you're ready down there.

171
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,028
Copy that.

172
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,549
Shane, come up to the bridge.

173
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,676
Okay.

174
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,740
What's up, Cap? Everything okay?

175
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:21,117
I don't like the look of that.

176
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:33,547
- Yeah, Cap.
- Chief, I want all your guys on station.

177
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:35,549
Still in the drill?

178
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:39,010
This is real-world. Someone coming up
on our starboard quarter.

179
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,887
Got it.

180
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,601
Port, 5 degrees.
Let's see if they follow us.

181
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:47,811
Port, 5.

182
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,373
Get the crew back
to their muster stations.

183
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,041
Right.

184
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,545
Attention, all crew.
Return to your muster stations.

185
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,715
Repeat, return to your muster stations.

186
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:20,594
This is not a drill.
This is a real-world situation.

187
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,806
- Yeah, Cap.
- I want to come up to 122.

188
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,225
Second mate and helmsman
to the bridge.

189
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,812
You're good. Bring her on up.

190
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,826
Now get me U.S. Maritime Emergency.

191
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,462
Two skiffs.
Can't tell how many they're carrying.

192
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:56,713
Copy that.

193
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:59,758
There's no answer
at the U.S. Maritime Emergency line.

194
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:02,135
- Raise the UKMTO.
- Right.

195
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,428
What's up?

196
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:06,348
We got two skiffs approaching.
Get on the radar.

197
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:14,397
Yeah, this is the Maersk Alabama.
Here's the captain.

198
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,441
UKMTO.

199
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,361
- Operations?
- Receiving.

200
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,987
This is the Maersk Alabama.

201
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:26,076
Our position is 2 degrees 2 north
by 49 degrees 19 east.

202
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:29,579
Our course is 180.
Our speed is 17 knots.

203
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:33,667
We have two skiffs approaching
at a distance of 1.5 miles...

204
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,961
...with a possible mothership following.

205
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,797
- Potential piracy situation.
- Copy, Alabama.

206
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:41,758
Alert your crew,
get your fire hoses ready...

207
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:44,052
...and follow lockdown procedures.

208
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:47,430
Yeah. Is that it?

209
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:51,393
I'm relaying your transmission now,
but chances are it's just fishermen.

210
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,436
They're not here to fish.

211
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,710
She's really big! Get ready!

212
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:20,213
You worry about yourself, skinny rat!

213
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,558
Both skiffs carrying armed men.

214
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:35,603
- Distance?
- One and a quarter miles and closing.

215
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:42,068
- Yeah, Cap.
- I wanna bring it up to 125.

216
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,574
- You're still good.
- One twenty-five.

217
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:04,049
Brothers,
we're going to make a lot of money!

218
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:06,176
Slow down! The waves are too big!

219
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:13,516
They're at one mile now, Cap.
Only one mile.

220
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:33,787
Coalition Warship 237,
this is Maersk Alabama.

221
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:36,331
Coalition Warship 237,
Maersk Alabama.

222
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,877
Go, Alabama.

223
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:45,799
Our position is 2 degrees 2 north
by 49 degrees 19 east.

224
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:51,387
Our course is 180.
Our speed is 18.5 knots.

225
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,849
We are being approached
by two pirate skiffs...

226
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:57,602
...with a possible mothership following.

227
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,438
We require immediate assistance.

228
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,607
We have a crew of 20.

229
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:07,570
We are preparing our weapons now
but request air support if possible.

230
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,697
Copy?

231
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,745
Copy, Alabama.

232
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:21,000
Be aware, a gunship is in the air.
ETA your position, five minutes.

233
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,753
Five minutes. Thank you, 237.

234
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:35,306
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?

235
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:39,310
We've got to get out of here!

236
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,939
Turn back, turn back!

237
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,526
What are you doing?

238
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:50,446
Where are you going?

239
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,825
Come on! Keep going!

240
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,455
Yeah, we got one down.

241
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:02,959
But the other one's still coming.
Half a mile out.

242
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:05,086
We need to make a bigger wake.

243
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,756
- Yeah.
- Cancel the limits. One two nine.

244
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:14,888
Yeah, you're on the edge
with Cylinder Number 5.

245
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,389
Do it.

246
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,350
- Port, 5 degrees.
- Port, 5 degrees.

247
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:33,114
Faster, faster!

248
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,535
They're at a quarter mile now.

249
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:40,538
- Starboard, 5 degrees.
- Starboard, 5 degrees.

250
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,586
Hurry, hurry! Go!

251
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:51,341
We're pushing this engine too hard!

252
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,274
Faster, faster!

253
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,342
Come on, let's go!

254
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:40,098
This thing is busted.

255
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,684
- Then fix it!
- I'm trying!

256
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,465
They're not messing around.
Lit us up from miles away.

257
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,967
Must've been tracking us.

258
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,469
Why doesn't the company
give us armed guards?

259
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,388
Move it in. The captain's here.

260
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:23,266
Blips on the radar that are clocking
at 27 knots.

261
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:25,935
They were moving.
We cannot outrun these guys.

262
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:31,190
Obviously, we all just went
through a dangerous situation.

263
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:35,653
Two skiffs, both with armed intruders.

264
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:40,533
Now, we all know that's a hazard
in these waters, but you performed well.

265
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,910
The ship performed well.

266
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,621
The authorities
have been made aware...

267
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,374
...so I think we have the situation
well in hand.

268
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:51,085
From now on,
we just follow our normal duties.

269
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:53,379
Mate, what do you got?

270
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:57,425
Yeah. We're all on double shifts
until we make it through these waters.

271
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:00,803
All right. Chief, can you keep
your engineers on roster?

272
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:03,431
We'll keep a guy in the ECR
around the clock.

273
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,934
All right. Enjoy your coffee.

274
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,478
Cap.

275
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,647
They're coming back.

276
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,525
Amen. Yeah, that's right.
They're coming back.

277
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:19,197
If they come back, we'll follow procedure.
They worked today, they'll work again.

278
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:23,701
We got the speed, we got the height,
we got hoses that can sink those skiffs.

279
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:27,789
We will follow the procedures even if
we have to shut down, lock down...

280
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,291
...go dead in the water
and wait for help.

281
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,461
Now, wait. I'm a u...
Okay, I'm a union guy, okay?

282
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,129
Twenty-five years, all right?

283
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:39,133
I'm telling you now that they're
not paying me enough to fight pirates.

284
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:42,220
You all signed up for a route
around the Horn of Africa.

285
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:45,848
- What did you expect?
- I didn't sign up for the Navy over here.

286
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:48,643
- You signed up for the route.
- For a cargo ship.

287
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:51,938
- What did you expect?
- Not getting attacked without weapons.

288
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:54,690
Why don't we get out of here?
Put room between us.

289
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,776
- Go where?
- In eight hours...

290
00:28:56,944 --> 00:29:00,321
...we could be a hundred miles from here.
- Hundred to a 150.

291
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:03,199
There's five pirate bands
in this part of the world.

292
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:06,911
You go out 300 miles, you run into one,
go 6, you run into another.

293
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:10,623
Our job is to move the cargo
as fast as possible. That's the job.

294
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,543
If anybody doesn't like it,
if anybody wants off...

295
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:17,797
...if anybody doesn't like this route
between Salalah, Djibouti and Mombasa...

296
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:21,134
...come to my office
and sign the paperwork per the union...

297
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:24,971
...and you'll be on the first flight home
out of Mombasa.

298
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:33,938
Enjoy your coffee.
Let's get back to work.

299
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:37,150
Go get those guys squared away,
will you?

300
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:20,485
The ocean was rough. Really rough.

301
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:24,614
Hufan, I'm telling you,
our boat couldn't take it.

302
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,492
Nothing was working for us.

303
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:30,828
Hurry up.

304
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:33,664
We need a bigger one for that ship.

305
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,542
I want this welded by the morning...

306
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,085
...by tomorrow, got it?

307
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,174
Elmi.

308
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,426
When will that engine be ready?

309
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,678
We've gotta fix it.

310
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,515
This thing is old and weak.

311
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,266
It's a piece of shit.

312
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:58,314
Shut up and fix it
for your crew of women.

313
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:05,446
Why don't you give me your engine?

314
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:10,284
Shut up, Skinny. You talk too much.

315
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:13,746
I may be skinny, but I'm not a coward.

316
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:22,463
What did you say?

317
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:24,799
Say it again!

318
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:29,095
You think you're somebody?

319
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:32,848
Say it again!

320
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:55,746
The coward is the first one in the grave.

321
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,450
Captain, this is Shane.

322
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,663
Yeah, go ahead.

323
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:39,874
I think you better get up here.

324
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:42,001
Coming.

325
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,843
- Where are they?
- Port quarter.

326
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:52,720
One-point-seven miles, captain.

327
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:58,392
Guy's coming on his own.

328
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:04,398
Sound the alarm.

329
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:07,526
Get U.S. Maritime Emergency for me.

330
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:16,077
Muster stations. This is not a drill.
Everyone to muster stations.

331
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,412
- This is not a drill.
- Come on.

332
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,164
Shit.

333
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:22,667
Come on. Let's go. Go.

334
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:25,961
- Yeah, Cap.
- They're coming back.

335
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,255
I want max revs. Take the limits off.

336
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,800
Copy that. Canceling all limits.

337
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:33,761
- Five degrees starboard.
- Starboard, 5 degrees.

338
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:45,815
Get ready.

339
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:57,034
U.S. Maritime Emergency line.

340
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:01,664
This is the Maersk Alabama.
We are under pirate attack at a...

341
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:04,583
- What's happening?
- Ken, get out here.

342
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,795
- I need eyes on the wing. Skiff coming in.
- I'm on it.

343
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:12,216
Our course is 166.
Our speed is 19 knots.

344
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:15,511
Copy that, Alabama.
Relaying to military channels now.

345
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,638
Copy that.

346
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,182
They're coming in fast, Cap.

347
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:22,810
Alabama.

348
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,105
Alabama ship.

349
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:29,859
Somali coast guard.
This is a routine check.

350
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,902
Stop your ship now.

351
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:37,074
We are coming aboard.
We're here to help you.

352
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:39,702
- Shane, they're dead astern.
- Jesus Christ.

353
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,833
- Yeah, Cap.
- We're gonna need the hoses.

354
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,043
Yeah, your pumps are good.

355
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:53,174
- Count it down for me, Shane.
- Yeah. They're at 800 yards.

356
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:55,468
- Prepare for hard turns.
- Stop now!

357
00:34:55,635 --> 00:35:00,473
- Standing by.
- Alabama, this is your final warning.

358
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,016
Stop the ship.

359
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:06,312
They're not stopping.

360
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,981
Show them who we are, Muse.

361
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,903
Shoot at them!

362
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:21,076
Shots fired! Shots fired! Hit the hoses.

363
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,252
Turn!

364
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,889
Coming in close, Cap.

365
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,239
Shane! Hose seven has slipped.

366
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,449
Bay 17. I'm on it. Shit.

367
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:03,786
- Be careful.
- I'm on Channel 3.

368
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,709
It's clear over there!

369
00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:17,716
They're coming back in.

370
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:28,602
Untie the ladder.

371
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,744
Give me the other one.

372
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,344
Shoot him!

373
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:10,519
Let's go, let's go!

374
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,646
Hurry up, Bilal.

375
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:14,857
Move your ass, kid.

376
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:30,247
Channel 3. Shane, get out of there.

377
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,541
Get everybody
down to the engine room.

378
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,793
I need you in command there.

379
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,840
Stop him!

380
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,265
All crew! All crew!

381
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:52,353
All crew to the engine room!
All crew to the engine room now!

382
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,272
Come on, let's go. Move it.

383
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:56,899
Come on, men.

384
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,574
Higher. Get it higher.

385
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:11,872
- Port, 30 degrees.
- Port, 30 degrees.

386
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,010
Hook it on!

387
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,645
They got the ladder up.
Starboard, 30 degrees.

388
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,355
Starboard, 30 degrees.

389
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:46,824
Get out of my way.

390
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,798
- Port, 30 degrees.
- Port, 30 degrees.

391
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,889
- Starboard, 30 degrees.
- Starboard, 30.

392
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:25,279
Someone's shooting at us.

393
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:28,073
Hang on.
Just get together against the wall.

394
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,576
- Cronan. Cronan.
- Yeah.

395
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:33,203
Hold them by the door.
We'll get a head count.

396
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,705
Go down to the door.

397
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,457
- Mike?
- Yeah.

398
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,710
- How long till you can shut her down?
- Five minutes.

399
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,316
Four pirates onboard.

400
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:05,903
Four pirates,
coming towards us down the main deck.

401
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:07,613
- Lock down the bridge.
- Yeah.

402
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:11,325
Listen up. We have been boarded
by four armed pirates.

403
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:13,827
You know the drill.

404
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:18,499
We stay hidden no matter what.
I don't want any hostages.

405
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,714
We stay locked down until help arrives.

406
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:30,469
No one comes out until you hear
the nonduress password, "suppertime."

407
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,847
Jesus.

408
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:37,309
If the pirates find you, remember,
you know the ship.

409
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:40,521
They don't.
Make them feel like they're in charge...

410
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:44,358
...but keep them away from the generator
and the engine controls.

411
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:51,907
Stick together...

412
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,201
...and we'll be all right.

413
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,286
Good luck.

414
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,208
Take everybody to the bottom
of the engine room.

415
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,210
Hide them behind the cylinders.

416
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:06,004
Try to split them
into groups of threes and fours.

417
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:26,984
- Hey! Don't move! Don't move!
- Okay, okay.

418
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:30,028
- Don't move, I said! Don't move!
- All right. All right.

419
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:31,613
Okay.

420
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,158
Okay. All right. Okay.

421
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,868
Don't move! We have four!

422
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:39,204
- All right, all right.
- Don't move! We have four! Four!

423
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:42,249
No, no.

424
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:46,211
Get away. Get over there.

425
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,512
Captain.

426
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:59,141
Relax. Nobody get hurt.

427
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,060
No al Qaeda here.

428
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:05,731
Just business. We want money.

429
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:10,903
When we get paid,
everything gonna be okay.

430
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,323
The ship.

431
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,074
Where from?

432
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:19,870
The ship? America.
It's an American ship.

433
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:22,664
America? Yes! Yes!

434
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,919
You?

435
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:29,254
Yankee?

436
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:32,674
Me? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Yankee-Irish. Yeah.

437
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:36,762
From now on
this one is called Irish, okay?

438
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,347
Irish. Irish.

439
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:45,187
Okay, Irish. What else you carrying?

440
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:46,396
What do you mean?

441
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,190
TV? Car?

442
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:50,859
TV and car...? No, no.
We just got the food...

443
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:52,736
Dollars?

444
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:56,907
We do. Kenny?
Kenny, what do we have in the safe?

445
00:42:57,075 --> 00:43:01,328
We got like, what, $30,000 in the safe?

446
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:06,667
Yeah, we got like... We have...
In the safe, we got $30,000.

447
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,252
It's yours.

448
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,004
Thirty thousand dollars?

449
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:14,216
What am I? Do I look like a beggar?

450
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:21,390
What's that?

451
00:43:25,395 --> 00:43:26,436
It's all right.

452
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,939
Hey, calm down! Calm down.

453
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:31,233
Get back there.

454
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:33,193
Yeah, yeah, over here.

455
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,823
We got a problem.

456
00:43:37,991 --> 00:43:40,784
We pushed the ship too hard.
We're off the grid.

457
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,412
That means
the computer's now off-line.

458
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:46,039
- Captain. Captain.
- The ship's broken.

459
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:49,626
No one get hurt
if you don't play no game.

460
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,672
It's... The ship's broken. We had to go...

461
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:58,093
Nobody gets hurt. Easy.

462
00:43:58,261 --> 00:43:59,511
Hey!

463
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:03,473
- Look at me.
- Sure.

464
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,225
I'm the captain now.

465
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,979
Watch this ugly one.

466
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:20,365
What are you doing?

467
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:22,743
I'm going to fix it.

468
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,911
Do you know how?

469
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,663
Hold the gun on him.

470
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:28,415
I've got him, don't worry.

471
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:35,047
Don't mess with anything
you don't know.

472
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,257
Come on, man.

473
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:43,805
- What are you doing?
- Just take care of that guy.

474
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:47,392
Stop the games.

475
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,147
Where is the crew?

476
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:54,858
I don't know. I don't know.
I'm here with you.

477
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:59,237
- Where is your crew?
- I don't know. Here, I'll call them up.

478
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:01,531
I'll get them up here, all right?

479
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:04,368
This is the captain speaking.

480
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:08,163
The pirates demand all crew members
to the bridge. All...

481
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:12,376
Every crew...

482
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:18,048
...one minute, I will kill someone.
One minute.

483
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:21,176
Another minute, I kill somebody.

484
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:25,222
I kill all your friends. One minute.

485
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:27,474
I will no call again.

486
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:33,271
Get that one
and put him against the wall.

487
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,690
- I'm trying...
- You think we playing?

488
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:38,276
- No, I'm doing the best...
- No play. No play.

489
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:41,613
- I'm doing the best I can.
- Easy, I kill you. Easy.

490
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:45,700
No, no. Look. You don't have to do that.

491
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,577
- Come on.
- You play? You play?

492
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:50,497
Take it easy, take it easy. No, no, no.

493
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:52,416
- No, look, look.
- Stop play!

494
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:56,503
Don't shoot him. Don't shoot him.
You're gonna shoot somebody, shoot me.

495
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:59,631
- Where is the crew, Irish?
- Forty seconds!

496
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:01,842
I don't know. I'm here with you.

497
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,219
No. Where is the crew?

498
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:05,637
I see nobody.

499
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:08,849
- I'm the captain. I'm the captain.
- Thirty second!

500
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,726
If you're gonna shoot somebody,
you shoot me.

501
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,603
- You killing him.
- It's my ship.

502
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:15,814
- Listen to me.
- You killing him.

503
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:18,316
I'm the captain.
I'm the captain, not them.

504
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:20,402
- Twenty second!
- This is between us.

505
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:25,407
I'm trying to straighten this out. Are you?
This is how you solve your problems?

506
00:46:25,575 --> 00:46:27,617
You said you just wanted money.

507
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:30,370
You said this was just business.
Is this business?

508
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:33,081
- Is this how you do business?
- Ten seconds.

509
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:34,624
Die right now.

510
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:46,136
Wait.

511
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:55,020
I want to search the ship.

512
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,565
You wanna search the ship?

513
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:03,945
I want to search every lock and hold
of the ship now.

514
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:05,780
- You wanna search the ship?
- Now.

515
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,991
All right. We'll search the ship.

516
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,785
We'll start on the nav deck
and work our way down.

517
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:13,330
We better hope
the emergency power stays on.

518
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:17,501
We won't be able to see if it goes off.
I'll take you. We'll search the ship.

519
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,669
But you stop threatening my men.

520
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,422
- No game.
- No game.

521
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,299
Let's go.

522
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,513
All right? All right, good.

523
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:32,182
Take his radio.

524
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:42,692
All right. Okay.

525
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:44,694
Go.

526
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,908
Gotta get these lights off.
They're gonna see us.

527
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:52,869
We need to shut down the generator
on the main deck.

528
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:55,038
- You think you can get up there?
- Yeah.

529
00:47:55,248 --> 00:47:58,917
I'm gonna go to the mess, get water.
Get everyone on the lower level.

530
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:00,877
All right. I'm on 2.

531
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:11,263
Just start at the very top.

532
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:13,807
This is E deck.

533
00:48:13,975 --> 00:48:18,353
And we'll just work our way down
one by one, huh?

534
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:42,168
Cargo hold is probably where they are.
There's a lot of places to hide.

535
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,004
And I'm not trying to trick you.

536
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:47,424
I wanna find these guys
just as much as you do.

537
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:50,427
Take his flashlight.

538
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:57,183
We should just move on,
because we're wasting time here.

539
00:48:57,351 --> 00:49:00,520
Like I say,
the cargo deck's the best place to look.

540
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:07,152
Somebody messing with ship.

541
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:11,323
Engine room.

542
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:14,951
If we're going about this systematically,
we started at the top...

543
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,747
...we're working our way down,
so we should try the cargo deck.

544
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,792
Problem from engine room.

545
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:25,420
We go there now.

546
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:27,839
All right. Engine room.

547
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:29,924
It's gonna be really hot down there.

548
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:33,053
Without the power on,
there's no ventilation, no air.

549
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:37,515
Maybe we should get some water
from the mess down on A deck?

550
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:46,441
- Then engine room. Go.
- Okay.

551
00:49:57,286 --> 00:49:59,162
This is A deck.

552
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:10,715
So here we are.

553
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,761
This is the galley.

554
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,101
This is where we make the food.

555
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:35,073
All right. Here, some water.

556
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:40,578
Check this room.

557
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:44,874
Oh, you wanna see in here?
This is cold storage.

558
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,292
It's a vegetable room.

559
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:55,051
Careful in here in the bare feet.

560
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:58,513
You could cut them
on almost anything.

561
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:03,935
Want some of this melon?
It's left over from breakfast.

562
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:06,938
It's just gonna go bad.
It's just gonna spoil.

563
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:10,692
It's usually left out
for the first meal of the day.

564
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:14,237
Maybe we should...
Go ahead, help yourself. Here you go.

565
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:17,699
Help yourself.
It's usually for breakfast, but...

566
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,668
Enough. Engine room.

567
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:30,420
All right.

568
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:53,359
- Cronan. Cronan. Do you read?
- Yeah, I got you.

569
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:56,529
They're on their way to you.
They're on their way to you.

570
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:57,739
One is barefoot.

571
00:51:57,907 --> 00:52:01,534
Is there glass you can break,
leave on the floor by the door?

572
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:05,038
I'll do it. Come on, let's go. Come on.

573
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,573
Here's the engine room.

574
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:45,829
Oh, my God.

575
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,498
Look out. There's broken glass.
Be careful.

576
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:51,751
- Put your hand up. Up your hands. Up.
- Okay, all right.

577
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:53,294
Up.

578
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:57,382
- There's a first-aid kit...
- Put your hands up!

579
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:02,053
- Who did this?
- Nobody. It was just a dumb accident.

580
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:05,557
We should get that looked at.
There's a kit in the control room.

581
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,643
Quiet, Irish. You think I am stupid?

582
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:10,436
I know what's going on.

583
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:14,858
We're going to search this whole room.
All of it. Now go.

584
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,443
Go.

585
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:41,009
I heard something!

586
00:54:00,613 --> 00:54:02,614
Check the other side.

587
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:05,158
There's no one here.

588
00:54:05,326 --> 00:54:07,493
Please, let's go back.

589
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:18,087
Go. Right down to the bottom. Now.

590
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,675
They're coming. Get ready.

591
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:42,195
Keep going. Move.

592
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,873
Wait. Stop here.

593
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:02,048
What? What'd you do?

594
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:05,176
- We just...
- Look at me, Irish. Look at me.

595
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,444
What's wrong with your ship?

596
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:25,488
- I don't know.
- Was that you?

597
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:27,532
- I don't know what went wrong.
- No.

598
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:31,494
You'll never find this crew,
not without any power on the ship.

599
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:34,163
You'll never find them.
We'll never find them.

600
00:55:35,124 --> 00:55:36,708
Irish...

601
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,002
...I will find.

602
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,296
Not with him.

603
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:45,008
Look. He's gonna bleed to death.

604
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,593
Look, man, get us out of here.

605
00:55:48,721 --> 00:55:51,055
You got a man injured.

606
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:53,307
Let's take care of his foot...

607
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:56,936
...take the money out of the safe
and call it a day. All right?

608
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:08,114
You're bad luck, Irish.

609
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:11,200
Hey, take him upstairs.

610
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,119
I can't move.

611
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:15,747
Take him upstairs
and tell Najee to come.

612
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:18,082
- You go with him.
- We're gonna go?

613
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,043
Go!

614
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:23,504
Hey.

615
00:56:23,672 --> 00:56:24,714
Wait.

616
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,175
You're not gonna find anybody.

617
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:30,011
Don't talk. Go.

618
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:47,153
Your friend make fool of us?
Make us run around?

619
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:50,865
If one of them moves,
send them to their graves.

620
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,244
Here.

621
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:17,243
Hey.

622
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:26,711
We got a problem.

623
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:29,088
Your buddy's hurt real bad.

624
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:31,674
We better get this dressed.

625
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:35,845
We got a sick bay here onboard,
and this guy knows what to do.

626
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,430
What happened to you?

627
00:58:37,598 --> 00:58:41,809
They put glass down for me.
They got me.

628
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:43,519
Where is Muse?

629
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:44,896
In the engine room.

630
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:48,941
He wants Najee to come down.

631
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:51,652
Bridge. Bridge, come in.

632
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:54,322
Alabama bridge, come in.
Do you read?

633
00:58:55,282 --> 00:59:00,244
This is the crew of the Maersk Alabama.
We have your captain.

634
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:02,747
Put your hand over his mouth.

635
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:04,874
- Hey.
- No.

636
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:06,417
We have your leader.

637
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:09,712
We have your captain and his weapon.
We wanna trade.

638
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,964
Captain for captain. We want a deal.

639
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:15,468
Take that off of his head.
Cronan, take that off his head now.

640
00:59:15,636 --> 00:59:16,761
I no kill.

641
00:59:16,929 --> 00:59:19,472
Talk. Talk to your friends
so they know it's you.

642
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:22,600
Talk to your friends.
Come on, asshole. Say something.

643
00:59:22,768 --> 00:59:24,644
I love America.

644
00:59:26,647 --> 00:59:29,607
Hey! Get me out of here!

645
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:32,652
Listen to what these guys have to say.

646
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:34,820
What happened?

647
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:37,281
They cut my hand, bad.

648
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:41,160
We'll straighten everything out later.
Just get me out of here.

649
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:43,537
Give Irish the radio.

650
00:59:45,457 --> 00:59:47,541
I'll give it to him now.

651
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:48,751
Talk.

652
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:55,633
Captain, you know,
if you wanna get off this ship...

653
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:59,595
...you don't have a skiff anymore,
but you could get into our lifeboat.
